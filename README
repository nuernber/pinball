Glen Lenker and Benjamin Nuernberger both worked on this project in
collaboration. Below is a breakdown of how we split up the work:

* Ben: There must be at least 10 pins and 4 walls for your pinball machine.
* Ben: The required pieces must be drawn using simple polygons (triangles or
quads), specifying the normal for each. You may draw other things (in-
cluding the pinball) using the convenience functions provided in assign-
ment 1. Also, you may fill the top of your cylinder with a sphere, so that
when viewed from the top it can be seen easily.
* Ben: When ’n’ is pressed, drawing of the normals should turn on and off
* Ben: All normals should have unit length and be located on the center of
the polygon they correspond to.
* Glen: The initial direction and location of the pinball should be chosen
randomly at runtime (unless you specify otherwise in the extra credit).
* Glen: When the pinball runs into a pin or a wall, it should reflect off
of it and continue along.
* Ben: Pressing ’v’ should toggle between viewing modes.
* Ben: The first mode should be a static top-down orthographic view of the
scene.
* Ben: The second mode should be an animated perspective flythrough which
forms a complete loop and repeats. The path of the camera is up to you,
but it must turn 360 degrees around the scene and zoom in or out at some
point during the process.
* Glen: The third mode should be a first person view of the ball as it
moves.
* Glen: Pressing ’s’ should draw a wireframe outline of the viewing volume
used in the third mode (in other words, the viewing volume of the pinball).
* Glen: Pressing ’r’ should reset the process, starting the pinball
somewhere else in the scene (randomly chosen).
* Glen: When resized, the aspect ratio of the objects in your scene should
stay the same (no stretching).
* Both of us: All code should be in one file, called pinball.cpp

We also added some extra credit as follows:
* pressing 'o' or 'p' will increase or decrease the pinball's speed.
* pressing 'x' will change the pinball into a robot.
